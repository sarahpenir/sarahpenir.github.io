I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences. I obtained my PhD in Genome Science (Dr rer nat) from Georg-August-Universität Göttingen as part of the International Max Planck Research School for Genome Science (IMPRS-GS). I also hold a Master's degree in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology from the University of the Philippines Diliman. I am an expert in the entire workflow of next-generation sequencing (NGS) research, including comprehensive bioinformatic analysis and sample preparation. With over a decade of experience, I specialize in developing advanced bioinformatics pipelines for genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. I am proficient in Python and R scripting, and am well-versed in the Unix environment. I am also a multidisciplinary scientist with extensive knowledge of molecular and cell biology.

This is a self-serving space that compiles some of the things I've learned over time, mostly about coding, bioinformatics, and statistics.
